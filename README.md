# PWM Control via a Web Interface Using a BeagleBone Black
This project, developed by Aziz Kerfahi and Mohamed Fedi Lafi, enables real-time control of a DC motor through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on a BeagleBone Black board. The project utilizes a web interface realized with nodejs to manage the PWM signals, allowing users to adjust the motor's speed and performance remotely and in real-time.
